# GameVault Backend

Welcome to **GameVault Backend**, the backend service for the GameVault system, responsible for managing user data, game collections, roles, and permissions. The backend provides APIs for the frontend to interact with and ensures the proper functioning of the system based on user roles (Admin, Moderator, and User).

## Features

- **User Management**:
  - Add, modify, and delete users from the system.
  - Assign roles to users, determining their level of access (Admin, Moderator, or User).
  - Handle authentication and authorization for secure access control.

- **Game Management**:
  - Store and manage game data in the database.
  - Assign games to users and manage their game collections.
  - Allow users with the appropriate roles to modify game details.

- **Role-based Permissions**:
  - **Admin**: Can create, update, and delete users. Manage game assignments for all users and edit any game in the system.
  - **Moderator**: Can view and edit only the games they have been assigned. Cannot manage users or view others' game collections.
  - **User**: Can view their own game collection and access their profile.

- **API Endpoints**:
  - Secure API endpoints for CRUD operations on users and games.
  - User authentication and session management.
  - Role-based access control for specific endpoints.

- **Database Integration**:
  - Store and manage all user and game data in a secure and scalable database.
  - Ensure data consistency and integrity through backend logic and validation.

- **Security**:
  - Implement authentication and authorization using JWT.
  - Ensure secure data transmission between the frontend and backend.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: 
  - Implement advanced search and filter options for games based on genre, release date, and other criteria.
  
- **Reporting Tools**:
  - Add reporting functionality for admins to view user activity and game statistics.

- **Notifications System**:
  - Implement a notifications feature to alert users about new game additions, updates, or other events.
